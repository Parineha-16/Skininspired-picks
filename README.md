The personal care industry is rapidly evolving, with users
becoming more conscious of their appearance, hygiene, and
overall wellness. However, many individuals struggle with
selecting the right products that cater to their specific skin,
hair, body, or nail needs. Most products are marketed
generally, and not everyone knows how to pick what truly suits
them.
Skinspired Picks is a user-friendly digital website that
addresses this challenge by offering personalized product
recommendations in four core areas: Skincare, Haircare,
Bodycare, and Nailcare. The website interacts with users
through a simple, intuitive interface that begins by collecting
basic information and leads them through multiple-choice
questions specific to the selected care category. Based on their
answers, the app recommends suitable products aligned with
their unique problems and preferences.
This document defines the software's requirements, system
behavior, and implementation scope. It is intended for
developers, testers, designers, and stakeholders to ensure
smooth development and delivery
